# CMSC-312 Assignment 2

This repository contains a collection of programs that demonstrate different inter-process communication (IPC) methods and multi-threading in C++, focusing on shared memory, semaphores, and process-thread synchronization.

## Structure

- `include/`: Header files for shared structures and utilities.
- `src/`: Source files for all IPC examples, including client-server socket programs and message queue examples.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- CMake (version 3.16 or higher)
- A C++ compiler supporting C++20 or higher (e.g., g++ or clang)
- VSCode (optional, with CMake Tools extension for easy building and running)

### Using VSCode Extension

1. Open the project folder in VSCode.
2. Ensure CMake Tools extension is installed.
3. Configure the project by selecting a kit (compiler).
4. Build the project by clicking the build button (âœ“) in the bottom blue bar.
5. Run any executable by clicking on the play button next to the build button.

### Using Command Line

In the project root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build      # Create and enter the build directory
cmake ..                     # Generate build system files
cmake --build .              # Compile the project
```

## Running Executables
After building, executables will be located in the build directory. They can be run with commands like:

```bash
./Part1   # For part 1 executable
./Part2   # For part 2 executable
./Part3   # For part 3 executable, use with arguments, e.g., ./Part3 5 10
```

## Programs by Part

### Part 1: Reader-Writer Problem Using Shared Memory

- Demonstrates the reader-writer problem using counting semaphores to synchronize access to shared memory.

### Part 2: Counting Semaphores with Binary Semaphores

- Implements counting semaphores using binary semaphores and tests them with a custom reader-writer problem.

### Part 3: Multi-Process and Multi-Threaded Implementation

- Converts writer logic to separate processes and maintains readers as threads, all synchronized using shared memory and semaphores.
